# The Programming Language Spectrum

## Example 1.3 Classification of programming languages

The many existing languages can be classified into families based on their model of computation. Figure 1.1 shows a common set of families. The top-level division distinguishes between the declarative languages, in which the focus is on what the computer is to do, and the imperative languages, in which the focus is on how the computer should do it.

现有的许多语言都可以根据其计算模型分为不同的族。图1.1显示了一组通用的族。顶级部门区分了声明性语言和命令性语言，在声明性语言中，重点是计算机的工作方式；在命令性语言中，重点是计算机的工作方式。

```
declarative
    functional Lisp/Scheme, ML, Haskell
    dataflow Id, Val
    logic, constraint-based Prolog, spreadsheets, SQL
imperative
    von Neumann C, Ada, Fortran, ...
    object-oriented Smalltalk,Eiffel, Java, ...
    scripting Perl, Python, PHP, ...
```
FIGURE 1.1 Classification of programming languages. Note that the categories are fuzzy and open to debate. In particular, it is possible for a functional language to be object-oriented, and many authors do not consider functional programming to be declarative.<br>图1.1编程语言的分类请注意，类别是模糊的，可以辩论。特别地，功能语言可能是面向对象的，并且许多作者并不认为功能编程是声明性的。

Declarative languages are in some sense “higher level”; they are more in tune with the programmer's point of view, and less with the implementor's point of view. Imperative languages predominate, however, mainly for performance reasons. There is a tension in the design of declarative languages between the desire to get away from “irrelevant” implementation details and the need to remain close enough to the details to at least control the outline of an algorithm. The design of efficient algorithms, after all, is what much of computer science is about. It is not yet clear to what extent, and in what problem domains, we can expect compilers to discover good algorithms for problems stated at a very high level of abstraction. In any domain in which the compiler cannot find a good algorithm, the programmer needs to be able to specify one explicitly.

声明性语言在某种意义上是“高级的”。它们更符合程序员的观点，而不符合实现者的观点。但是，命令式语言占主导地位，主要是出于性能方面的考虑。在声明语言的设计中，要摆脱“不相关的”实现细节和保持足够接近细节以至少控制算法的轮廓之间存在张力。毕竟，高效算法的设计是计算机科学的重中之重。尚不清楚在何种程度上，在什么问题领域中，我们可以期望编译器发现用于以非常高的抽象水平陈述的问题的良好算法。在编译器无法找到好的算法的任何领域，程序员都需要能够明确指定一个算法。

Within the declarative and imperative families, there are several important subfamilies:

在声明式和命令式家族中，有几个重要的子家族：

* Functional languages employ a computational model based on the recursive definition of functions. They take their inspiration from the lambda calculus, a formal computational model developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. In essence, a program is considered a function from inputs to outputs, defined in terms of simpler functions through a process of refinement. Languages in this category include Lisp, ML, and Haskell. <br> 函数语言基于函数的递归定义采用计算模型。他们从lambda演算中汲取了灵感，lambda演算是由Alonzo Church在1930年代开发的正式计算模型。本质上，程序被认为是从输入到输出的功能，通过精炼过程来定义更简单的功能。此类别中的语言包括Lisp，ML和Haskell。
* Dataflow languages model computation as the flow of information (tokens) among primitive functional nodes. They provide an inherently parallel model: nodes are triggered by the arrival of input tokens, and can operate concurrently. Id and Val are examples of dataflow languages. Sisal, a descendant of Val, is more often described as a functional language. <br> 数据流语言将计算建模为原始功能节点之间的信息（令牌）流。它们提供了一个固有的并行模型：节点由输入令牌的到达触发，并且可以并行运行。 Id和Val是数据流语言的示例。 Sisal是Val的后代，通常被描述为一种功能语言。
* Logic or constraint-based languages take their inspiration from predicate logic. They model computation as an attempt to find values that satisfy certain specified relationships, using goal-directed search through a list of logical rules. Prolog is the best-known logic language. The term is also sometimes applied to the SQL database language, the XSLT scripting language, and programmable aspects of spreadsheets such as Excel and its predecessors. <br> 逻辑或基于约束的语言从谓词逻辑中汲取灵感。他们使用目标导向的搜索通过一系列逻辑规则，将计算建模为试图找到满足某些特定关系的值的尝试。 Prolog是最著名的逻辑语言。该术语有时也用于SQL数据库语言，XSLT脚本语言以及电子表格（例如Excel）及其前身的可编程方面。
* The von Neumann languages are probably the most familiar and widely used. They include Fortran, Ada, C, and all of the others in which the basic means of computation is the modification of variables.7 Whereas functional languages are based on expressions that have values, von Neumann languages are based on statements (assignments in particular) that influence subsequent computation via the side effect of changing the value of memory. <br> 冯·诺依曼语言可能是最熟悉和使用最广泛的语言。它们包括Fortran，Ada，C以及所有其他其中的基本计算方法是对变量进行修改的方法。7虽然功能语言基于具有值的表达式，但冯·诺依曼语言基于语句（尤其是赋值）通过更改内存值的副作用影响后续计算。
* Object-oriented languages trace their roots to Simula 67. Most are closely related to the von Neumann languages, but have a much more structured and distributed model of both memory and computation. Rather than picture computation as the operation of a monolithic processor on a monolithic memory, object-oriented languages picture it as interactions among semi-independent objects, each of which has both its own internal state and subroutines to manage that state. Smalltalk is the purest of the object-oriented languages; C++ and Java are probably the most widely used. It is also possible to devise object-oriented functional languages (the best known of these are CLOS [Kee89] and OCaml), but they tend to have a strong imperative flavor. <br> 面向对象的语言起源于Simula 67.大多数语言与von Neumann语言密切相关，但是具有更加结构化和分布式的内存和计算模型。面向对象的语言不是将计算视为单片处理器在单片存储器上的操作，而是将其视为半独立对象之间的交互，每个半独立对象都有自己的内部状态和用于管理该状态的子例程。 Smalltalk是最纯粹的面向对象语言。 C++和Java可能是使用最广泛的。也可以设计面向对象的功能语言（其中最著名的是CLOS [Kee89]和OCaml），但是它们往往具有很强的命令性风格。
* Scripting languages are distinguished by their emphasis on coordinating or “gluing together” components drawn from some surrounding context. Several scripting languages were originally developed for specific purposes: csh and bash are the input languages of job control (shell) programs; PHP and JavaScript are primarily intended for the generation of dynamic web content; Lua is widely used to control computer games. Other languages, including Perl, Python, and Ruby, are more deliberately general purpose. Most place an emphasis on rapid prototyping, with a bias toward ease of expression over speed of execution. <br> 脚本语言的突出特点是强调协调或“融合”从周围环境中提取的组件。最初为特定目的开发了几种脚本语言：csh和bash是作业控制（shell）程序的输入语言； csh和bash是作业控制（shell）程序的输入语言。 PHP和JavaScript主要用于生成动态Web内容。 Lua被广泛用于控制计算机游戏。其他语言，包括Perl，Python和Ruby，都是故意的通用目的。大多数人都强调快速原型设计，倾向于在执行速度上易于表达。

One might suspect that concurrent (parallel) languages would form a separate family (and indeed this book devotes a chapter to such languages), but the distinction between concurrent and sequential execution is mostly independent of the classifications above. Most concurrent programs are currently written using special library packages or compilers in conjunction with a sequential language such as Fortran or C. A few widely used languages, including Java, C#, and Ada, have explicitly concurrent features. Researchers are investigating concurrency in each of the language families mentioned here. 

有人可能会怀疑并发（并行）语言会形成一个独立的家族（确实，这本书专门为此类语言专门写了一章），但是并发执行和顺序执行之间的区别在很大程度上与上述分类无关。当前，大多数并发程序是使用特殊的库软件包或编译器与顺序语言（例如Fortran或C）结合编写的。几种广泛使用的语言（包括Java，C#和Ada）具有显式的并发功能。研究人员正在研究此处提到的每个语言家族的并发性。

## Example 1.4 GCD function in C

As a simple example of the contrast among language families, consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) problem introduced at the beginning of this chapter. The choice among, say, von Neumann, functional, or logic programming for this problem influences not only the appearance of the code, but how the programmer thinks. The von Neumann algorithm version of the algorithm is very imperative:

作为语言族之间对比的一个简单示例，请考虑本章开头介绍的最大公约数（GCD）问题。冯·诺依曼（von Neumann），函数式或逻辑编程中对此问题的选择不仅影响代码的外观，而且影响程序员的思维方式。该算法的von Neumann算法版本非常必要：

> *To compute the gcd of a and b, check to see if a and b are equal. If so, print one of them and stop. Otherwise, replace the larger one by their difference and repeat.*
> 要计算a和b的gcd，请检查a和b是否相等。如果是这样，请打印其中之一并停止。否则，用它们之间的差异替换较大的一个并重复。

C code for this algorithm appears at the top of Figure 1.2.

此算法的C代码出现在图1.2的顶部。

```c
int gcd(int a, int b) {                   // C
    while (a != b) {
        if (a > b) a = a - b;
        else b = b - a;
    }
    return a;
}
```

```ocaml
let rec gcd a b =                         (* OCaml *)
    if a = b then a
    else if a > b then gcd b (a - b)
        else gcd a (b - a)
```

```prolog
gcd(A,B,G) :- A = B, G = A.                % Prolog
gcd(A,B,G) :- A > B, C is A-B, gcd(C,B,G).
gcd(A,B,G) :- B > A, C is B-A, gcd(C,A,G).
```

FIGURE 1.2 The GCD algorithm in C (top), OCaml (middle), and Prolog (bottom). All three versions assume (without checking) that their inputs are positive integers.

## Example 1.5 GCD function in OCaml

In a functional language, the emphasis is on the mathematical relationship of outputs to inputs:

> *The gcd of a and b is defined to be (1) a when a and b are equal, (2) the gcd of b and a − b when a > b, and (3) the gcd of a and b − a when b > a. To compute the gcd of a given pair of numbers, expand and simplify this definition until it terminates.*

An OCaml version of this algorithm appears in the middle of Figure 1.2. The keyword let introduces a definition; rec indicates that it is permitted to be recursive (self-referential); arguments for a function come between the name (in this case, gcd) and the equals sign.

## Example 1.6 GCD rules in Prolog

In a logic language, the programmer specifies a set of axioms and proof rules that allows the system to find desired values:

在逻辑语言中，程序员指定一组公理和证明规则，以使系统能够找到所需的值：

> *The proposition gcd(a, b, g) is true if (1) a, b, and g are all equal; (2) a is greater than b and there exists a number c such that c is a − b and gcd(c, b, g) is true; or (3) a is less than b and there exists a number c such that c is b − a and gcd(c, a, g) is true. To compute the gcd of a given pair of numbers, search for a number g (and various numbers c) for which these rules allow one to prove that gcd(a, b, g) is true.*
> 如果（1）a，b和g都相等，则命题gcd（a，b，g）为真。 （2）a大于b并且存在一个数字c，使得c为a-b并且gcd（c，b，g）为真；或（3）a小于b且存在一个数字c，使得c为b-a且gcd（c，a，g）为真。要计算给定数字对的gcd，请搜索数字g（以及各种数字c），对于这些数字，这些规则允许一个人证明gcd（a，b，g）是正确的。

A Prolog version of this algorithm appears at the bottom of Figure 1.2. It may be easier to understand if one reads “if” for :- and “and” for commas.

该算法的Prolog版本显示在图1.2的底部。如果人们对：-读为“ if”，对于逗号读为“ and”，则可能更容易理解。 

It should be emphasized that the distinctions among language families are not clear-cut. The division between the von Neumann and object-oriented languages, for example, is often very fuzzy, and many scripting languages are also object-oriented. Most of the functional and logic languages include some imperative features, and several recent imperative languages have added functional features. The descriptions above are meant to capture the general flavor of the families, without providing formal definitions.

应该强调的是，语言族之间的区别并不明确。例如，冯·诺伊曼（von Neumann）和面向对象的语言之间的划分通常非常模糊，许多脚本语言也都是面向对象的。大多数功能和逻辑语言都包含一些命令性功能，而几种最新的命令性语言已添加了功能性功能。上面的描述旨在捕获家庭的总体风味，而没有提供正式的定义。

Imperative languages—von Neumann and object-oriented—receive the bulk of the attention in this book. Many issues cut across family lines, however, and the interested reader will discover much that is applicable to alternative computational models in most chapters of the book. Chapters 11 through 14 contain additional material on functional, logic, concurrent, and scripting languages.

命令式语言（冯·诺依曼和面向对象）在本书中获得了很大的关注。但是，许多问题涉及家庭，而有兴趣的读者会在本书的大多数章节中发现许多适用于替代计算模型的内容。第11章至第14章包含有关功能，逻辑，并发和脚本语言的其他材料。
