# Programming Environments

Compilers and interpreters do not exist in isolation. Programmers are assisted in their work by a host of other tools. Assemblers, debuggers, preprocessors, and linkers were mentioned earlier. Editors are familiar to every programmer. They may be augmented with cross-referencing facilities that allow the programmer to find the point at which an object is defined, given a point at which it is used. Pretty printers help enforce formatting conventions. Style checkers enforce syntactic or semantic conventions that may be tighter than those enforced by the compiler (see Exploration 1.14). Configuration management tools help keep track of dependences among the (many versions of) separately compiled modules in a large software system. Perusal tools exist not only for text but also for intermediate languages that may be stored in binary. Profilers and other performance analysis tools often work in conjunction with debuggers to help identify the pieces of a program that consume the bulk of its computation time.

编译器和解释器不是孤立存在的。程序员还可以通过许多其他工具来协助他们的工作。前面提到了汇编器，调试器，预处理器和链接器。每个程序员都熟悉编辑器。可以使用交叉引用功能来增强它们，这些功能允许程序员在给定使用对象的位置的情况下找到定义对象的位置。漂亮的打印机有助于强制执行格式约定。样式检查器执行的语法或语义约定可能比编译器执行的语法或语义约定更严格（请参见探索1.14）。配置管理工具有助于跟踪大型软件系统中（多个版本）单独编译的模块之间的依赖性。实用工具不仅适用于文本，还适用于可能以二进制形式存储的中间语言。探查器和其他性能分析工具通常与调试器结合使用，以帮助识别消耗大量计算时间的程序片段。

In older programming environments, tools may be executed individually, at the explicit request of the user. If a running program terminates abnormally with a “bus error” (invalid address) message, for example, the user may choose to invoke a debugger to examine the “core” file dumped by the operating system. He or she may then attempt to identify the program bug by setting breakpoints, enabling tracing and so on, and running the program again under the control of the debugger. Once the bug is found, the user will invoke the editor to make an appropriate change. He or she will then recompile the modified program, possibly with the help of a configuration manager.

在较旧的编程环境中，可以应用户的明确要求单独执行工具。例如，如果正在运行的程序以“总线错误”（无效地址）消息异常终止，则用户可以选择调用调试器来检查操作系统转储的“核心”文件。然后，他或她可以尝试通过设置断点，启用跟踪等，并在调试器的控制下再次运行程序来识别程序错误。一旦发现错误，用户将调用编辑器进行适当的更改。然后，他或她将可能在配置管理器的帮助下重新编译修改后的程序。

Modern environments provide more integrated tools. When an invalid address error occurs in an integrated development environment (IDE), a new window is likely to appear on the user's screen, with the line of source code at which the error occurred highlighted. Breakpoints and tracing can then be set in this window without explicitly invoking a debugger. Changes to the source can be made without explicitly invoking an editor. If the user asks to rerun the program after making changes, a new version may be built without explicitly invoking the compiler or configuration manager.

现代环境提供了更多集成的工具。当在集成开发环境（IDE）中发生无效的地址错误时，用户屏幕上可能会出现一个新窗口，其中高亮显示了发生错误的源代码行。然后可以在此窗口中设置断点和跟踪，而无需显式调用调试器。无需显式调用编辑器即可对源进行更改。如果用户在进行更改后要求重新运行程序，则可以在不显式调用编译器或配置管理器的情况下构建新版本。

The editor for an IDE may incorporate knowledge of language syntax, providing templates for all the standard control structures, and checking syntax as it is typed in. Internally, the IDE is likely to maintain not only a program's source and object code, but also a partially compiled internal representation. When the source is edited, the internal representation will be updated automatically—often incrementally (without reparsing large portions of the source). In some cases, structural changes to the program may be implemented first in the internal representation, and then automatically reflected in the source.

IDE的编辑器可能会结合语言语法知识，为所有标准控件结构提供模板以及在键入时检查语法。在内部，IDE可能不仅会维护程序的源代码和目标代码，还会维护程序的源代码和目标代码。部分编译的内部表示形式。编辑源代码后，内部表示形式将自动更新-通常以增量方式更新（无需重新解析源代码的大部分）。在某些情况下，可以首先在内部表示中实现对程序的结构更改，然后自动在源中反映出来。

IDEs are fundamental to Smalltalk—it is nearly impossible to separate the language from its graphical environment—and have been routinely used for Common Lisp since the 1980s. With the ubiquity of graphical interfaces, integrated environments have largely displaced command-line tools for many languages and systems. Popular open-source IDEs include Eclipse and NetBeans. Commercial systems include the Visual Studio environment from Microsoft and the XCode environment from Apple. Much of the appearance of integration can also be achieved within sophisticated editors such as emacs.

IDE是Smalltalk的基础-几乎不可能将语言从其图形环境中分离出来-并且自1980年代以来一直被Common Lisp使用。由于图形界面无处不在，因此集成环境已大大取代了许多语言和系统的命令行工具。流行的开源IDE包括Eclipse和NetBeans。商业系统包括Microsoft的Visual Studio环境和Apple的XCode环境。集成的许多外观也可以在复杂的编辑器（例如emacs）中实现。

## Design & Implementation
### 1.4 Powerful development environments

Sophisticated development environments can be a two-edged sword. The quality of the Common Lisp environment has arguably contributed to its widespread acceptance. On the other hand, the particularity of the graphical environment for Smalltalk (with its insistence on specific fonts, window styles, etc.) made it difficult to port the language to systems accessed through a textual interface, or to graphical systems with a different “look and feel.”

复杂的开发环境可能是一把两刃剑。可以肯定的是，Common Lisp环境的质量为其广泛接受做出了贡献。另一方面，Smalltalk图形环境的特殊性（坚持使用特定的字体，窗口样式等）使得很难将语言移植到通过文本界面访问的系统，或移植到具有不同“外观和感觉。”
