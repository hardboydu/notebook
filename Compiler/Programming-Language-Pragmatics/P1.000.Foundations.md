# Foundations

A central premise of *Programming Language Pragmatics* is that language design and implementation are intimately connected; it's hard to study one without the other.

*编程语言（Pragmatics）语用学*的中心前提是语言的设计与实现，这两者紧密相连，缺一不可。

The bulk of the text—Parts II and III—is organized around topics in language design, but with detailed coverage throughout of the many ways in which design decisions have been shaped by implementation concerns.

本书的大部分（第二部分和第三部分）是围绕语言设计的主题而组织的，但是详细涵盖了因实施问题而影响设计决策的许多方式。

The first five chapters—Part I—set the stage by covering foundational material in both design and implementation. Chapter 1 motivates the study of programming languages, introduces the major language families, and provides an overview of the compilation process. Chapter 3 covers the high-level structure of programs, with an emphasis on names, the binding of names to objects, and the scope rules that govern which bindings are active at any given time. In the process it touches on storage management; subroutines, modules, and classes; polymorphism; and separate compilation.

前五章（第I部分）通过介绍设计和实施中的基础材料来奠定基础。 第1章激发了对编程语言的研究，介绍了主要的语言系列，并概述了编译过程。 第3章介绍程序的高级结构，着重于名称，名称与对象的绑定以及范围规则，该范围规则控制在任何给定时间激活的绑定。 在此过程中，它涉及存储管理； 子例程，模块和类； 多态性 并分别进行编译。

Chapters 2, 4, and 5 are more implementation oriented. They provide the background needed to understand the implementation issues mentioned in Parts II and III. Chapter 2 discusses the syntax, or textual structure, of programs. It introduces regular expressions and context-free grammars, which designers use to describe program syntax, together with the scanning and parsing algorithms that a compiler or interpreter uses to recognize that syntax. Given an understanding of syntax, Chapter 4 explains how a compiler (or interpreter) determines the semantics, or meaning of a program. The discussion is organized around the notion of attribute grammars, which serve to map a program onto something else that has meaning, such as mathematics or some other existing language. Finally, Chapter 5 (entirely on the companion site) provides an overview of assembly-level computer architecture, focusing on the features of modern microprocessors most relevant to compilers. Programmers who understand these features have a better chance not only of understanding why the languages they use were designed the way they were, but also of using those languages as fully and effectively as possible.

第2、4和5章更着重于实现。它们提供了理解第二部分和第三部分提到的实施问题所需的背景。第2章讨论程序的语法或文本结构。它介绍了设计人员用来描述程序语法的正则表达式和上下文无关的语法，以及编译器或解释器用来识别该语法的扫描和解析算法。在了解了语法之后，第4章介绍了编译器（或解释器）如何确定程序的语义或含义。讨论围绕属性语法的概念进行，属性语法用于将程序映射到其他有意义的事物上，例如数学或其他现有语言。最后，第5章（整个在配套站点上）提供了汇编级计算机体系结构的概述，重点介绍了与编译器最相关的现代微处理器的功能。理解这些功能的程序员不仅有更好的机会了解为什么要使用自己设计的语言，而且还要尽可能充分和有效地使用这些语言。
