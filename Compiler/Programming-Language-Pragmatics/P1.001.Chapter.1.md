# Introduction

## Example 1.1 GCD program in x86 machine language

The first electronic computers were monstrous contraptions, filling several rooms, consuming as much electricity as a good-size factory, and costing millions of 1940s dollars (but with much less computing power than even the simplest modern cell phone). The programmers who used these machines believed that the computer's time was more valuable than theirs. They programmed in machine language. Machine language is the sequence of bits that directly controls a processor, causing it to add, compare, move data from one place to another, and so forth at appropriate times. Specifying programs at this level of detail is an enormously tedious task. The following program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, using Euclid's algorithm. It is written in machine language, expressed here as hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, for the x86 instruction set.

第一台电子计算机是巨大的设备，充满了数个房间，消耗的电力相当于一个大型工厂的电力，耗资数百万美元（1940年代）（但比起最简单的现代手机，其计算能力也要低得多）。使用这些机器的程序员认为，计算机的时间比他们的时间更有价值。他们用机器语言编程。机器语言是直接控制处理器的位序列，导致处理器在适当的时间将数据从一个位置添加到另一个位置，进行比较，将数据移动到另一个位置，依此类推。以这种详细级别指定程序是一项非常繁琐的任务。下面的程序使用Euclid算法计算两个整数的最大公约数（GCD）。它是用x86指令集的机器语言编写的，这里用十六进制（基数16）表示。

## Example 1.2 GCD program in x86 assembler

As people began to write larger programs, it quickly became apparent that a less error-prone notation was required. Assembly languages were invented to allow operations to be expressed with mnemonic abbreviations. Our GCD program looks like this in x86 assembly language:

当人们开始编写更大的程序时，很快变得很明显，需要了一个不太容易出错的表示法。发明了汇编语言以允许使用助记符缩写表示操作。我们的GCD程序在x86汇编语言中看起来像这样：

```asm
    pushl %ebp
    movl %esp, %ebp
    pushl %ebx
    subl $4, %esp
    andl $-16, %esp
    call getint
    movl %eax, %ebx
    call getint
    cmpl %eax, %ebx
    je C
A:  cmpl %eax, %ebx
    jle D
    subl %eax, %ebx
B:  cmpl %eax, %ebx
    jne A
C:  movl %ebx, (%esp)
    call putint
    movl -4(%ebp), %ebx
    leave
    ret
D:  subl %ebx, %eax
    jmp B 
```

Assembly languages were originally designed with a one-to-one correspondence between mnemonics and machine language instructions, as shown in this example.<sup>1</sup> Translating from mnemonics to machine language became the job of a systems program known as an *assembler*. Assemblers were eventually augmented with elaborate “macro expansion” facilities to permit programmers to define parameterized abbreviations for common sequences of instructions. The correspondence between assembly language and machine language remained obvious and explicit, however. Programming continued to be a machine-centered enterprise: each different kind of computer had to be programmed in its own assembly language, and programmers thought in terms of the instructions that the machine would actually execute.

汇编语言最初是在助记符和机器语言指令之间一一对应的方式设计的，如本示例所示<sup>1</sup>。从助记符到机器语言的转换成为系统程序的工作，称为*汇编程序*。最终，汇编程序增加了精心设计的“宏扩展”功能，以允许程序员为通用指令序列定义参数化缩写。但是，汇编语言和机器语言之间的对应关系仍然很明显。编程仍然是一个以机器为中心的企业：每种不同类型的计算机都必须以其自己的汇编语言进行编程，而程序员则根据机器实际执行的指令进行思考。

> <sup>1</sup> The 22 lines of assembly code in the example are encoded in varying numbers of bytes in machine language. The three cmp (compare) instructions, for example, all happen to have the same register operands, and are encoded in the two-byte sequence (39 c3). The four mov (move) instructions have different operands and lengths, and begin with 89 or 8b. The chosen syntax is that of the GNU gcc compiler suite, in which results overwrite the last operand, not the first.

As computers evolved, and as competing designs developed, it became increasingly frustrating to have to rewrite programs for every new machine. It also became increasingly difficult for human beings to keep track of the wealth of detail in large assembly language programs. People began to wish for a machine-independent language, particularly one in which numerical computations (the most common type of program in those days) could be expressed in something more closely resembling mathematical formulae. These wishes led in the mid-1950s to the development of the original dialect of Fortran, the first arguably high-level programming language. Other high-level languages soon followed, notably Lisp and Algol.

随着计算机的发展以及竞争性设计的发展，不得不为每台新机器重写程序变得越来越令人沮丧。人们越来越难以掌握大型汇编语言程序中的大量细节。人们开始希望使用一种与机器无关的语言，尤其是一种可以用更类似于数学公式的形式来表示数值计算（当时最常见的程序类型）的语言。这些愿望在1950年代中期导致了Fortran的原始方言的发展，Fortran是最早的高级编程语言。紧随其后的是其他高级语言，尤其是Lisp和Algol。

Translating from a high-level language to assembly or machine language is the job of a systems program known as a compiler.<sup>2</sup> Compilers are substantially more complicated than assemblers because the one-to-one correspondence between source and target operations no longer exists when the source is a high-level language. Fortran was slow to catch on at first, because human programmers, with some effort, could almost always write assembly language programs that would run faster than what a compiler could produce. Over time, however, the performance gap has narrowed, and eventually reversed. Increases in hardware complexity (due to pipelining, multiple functional units, etc.) and continuing improvements in compiler technology have led to a situation in which a state-of-the-art compiler will usually generate better code than a human being will. Even in cases in which human beings can do better, increases in computer speed and program size have made it increasingly important to economize on programmer effort, not only in the original construction of programs, but in subsequent program maintenance—enhancement and correction. Labor costs now heavily outweigh the cost of computing hardware.

从高级语言转换为汇编语言或机器语言是称为编译器的系统程序的工作。<sup>2</sup>编译器比汇编器复杂得多，因为当源操作和目标操作之间不再存在一对一的对应关系时，来源是一种高级语言。一开始，Fortran 的普及速度很慢，因为人类程序员几乎可以总是编写出汇编语言程序，这些程序的运行速度比编译器生成的程序要快。但是，随着时间的流逝，性能差距已经缩小，并最终得以扭转。硬件复杂性的增加（由于流水线，多个功能单元等）以及编译器技术的不断改进，导致了这样一种情况，即最先进的编译器通常会生成比人类更好的代码。即使在人类可以做得更好的情况下，计算机速度和程序大小的增加也使得节约程序员的精力变得越来越重要，这不仅在程序的原始结构中，而且在后续程序的维护（增强和修正）中也是如此。现在，人工成本大大超过了计算硬件的成本。

> <sup>2</sup> High-level languages may also be interpreted directly, without the translation step. We will return to this option in Section 1.4. It is the principal way in which scripting languages like Python and JavaScript are implemented.
